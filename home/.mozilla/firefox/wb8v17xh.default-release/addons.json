This extension only aims to give the user some options that are already available and supported in the code.\n\nIf it gets stuck or acts weird, hit ctrl-F5 (or shift-click the reload button) to reload without using the cache. This may be occasionally required, but should not be required after disabling or removing the extension. If it does, that's likely a bug on my end, or another change in web-extension or caching behavior by Firefox.\n\nAlso get in touch for any issues whatsoever, please. I'm doing everything I can to maintain this and be responsive, but I'm just one person and some problems are on Netflix's end.
